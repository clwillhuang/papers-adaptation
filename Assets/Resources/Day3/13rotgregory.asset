  message: It is a core tenet of the Party that man only becomes human after surrendering
    his individuality to a higher power, and no one exemplifies this better than Private
    \c30Gregory Davies\c30. Pvt. \c31Davies\c31 protected the rest of his unit during
    an ambush by yelling loudwise and flailing wildwise to draw enemy fire towards
    himself, saving the lives of many of his comrades. Pvt. \c32Davies\c32 will never
    be forgetted by us - he was a man amongst mans, and a true follower of the Party.
