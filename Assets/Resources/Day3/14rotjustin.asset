  message: "As much as we detest spies against Oceania, we must remember to love the
    unspies that turn Eurasian secrets into Oceanian victorys. Lt. \\c30Chalmers\\c30
    sacrificed his life to deliver doubleplusimportant information to Minipax command,
    making the victory at Brazzaville possible. \\c31Justin Chalmers\\c31 was a brave
    man - he exhibited none of the cowardice or treachery of a spy, and all of the
    loyal traits of a doubleplusgood Party member. Everyday he would ask what he could
    sacrifice to serve us - now it is our turn to ask, \u201CHow can we serve Big
    Brother?\u201D"
