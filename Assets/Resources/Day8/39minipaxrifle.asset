  message: Minipax announced yesterday in their daily war update broadcast that they
    are to replace the standard BBR-03 guns provided to troops with the new BFB, which
    has a magazine size of 144 bullets, and a 24 inch bayonet for more efficient melee
    combat. Possible modifys include a miniature flamethrower or an assault chainsaw
    attached to the barrel.  The \d50old\d50 model is to be phased out of service
    once all military units have received the new model.
