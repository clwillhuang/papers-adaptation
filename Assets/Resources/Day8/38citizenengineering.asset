  message: In response to the string of technologyful innovations at the Minipax,
    Miniluv has revealed itself no stranger to the technologyful area with their Citizen
    Engineering Protocol (CEP) . Through the use of eugenic technology and genetic
    modifys, childs born through the CEP will have loyalty to Big Brother embedded
    in their DNA - a prospect so amazing that thousands have signed up to be surrogate
    parents for the first line of engineered citizens. The citizens \d20whom\d20 this
    project will create will be perfect and \dA1absolutely\dA1 loyal to Big Brother.
    The future is looking bright - Long Live Big Brother!
