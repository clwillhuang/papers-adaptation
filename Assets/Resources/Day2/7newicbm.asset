  message: "Minipax has unveiled a new intercontinental ballistic missile, dubbed
    the \u201CPlusbig Brother\u201D. The new missile is three times faster and \\dB0more
    destructive\\dB0 than previous models. Some speculate that the missile has the
    power to turn mountains into dust, and may provide a decisionful victory in the
    Outer Outer Outer Inner Eurasian campaign. Only time will tell, but regardless,
    we must all feel grateful that we are on the right side, and that we unwill be
    on the receiving end of such a powerful weapon."
