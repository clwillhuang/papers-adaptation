  message: "In a speak made yesterday, Big Brother commented on various aspects of
    the Eastern Eurasian campaign, noting that Western Eastern Eurasia would fall
    in a few months, giving Oceania a new foothold in the region. More immediatewise,
    Big Brother predicts an easy victory against \\d50disorganized\\d50 enemy \\d81armies\\d81
    in Outsorstan within the next week, leading to Oceanian control of the never before
    conquered \u201CGraveyard of Empires\u201D. With the fall of Outsorstan, the chocolate
    ration is predicted to increase by 3 grams as the nation\u2019s cocoa groves enter
    our control. Long Live Big Brother!"
