  message: "With no end to their cruelty, The Eurasian soldiers slaughtered over 10000
    mans and womans, and 5000 \\d80children\\d80 in Hong Kong as part of a routine
    training drill reportedwise called \u201CThe London Manoeuvre\u201D.  The Eurasian
    front may seem halfway across the world, but pro-Eurasian terrorist cells can
    be finded all across Oceania, trained to murder civilians at the drop of a hat.
    It is our duty as citizens to report a potentialwise pro-Eurasian activity, lest
    our gloryful city becomes overrun with bloodthirstful Eurasians, goodwise versed
    in \u201CThe London Manoeuvre\u201D and many other forms of rehearsed cruelty."
