  message: "The ever-loyal Spies have formed a Youth Newspeak Alliance, as part of
    the Party\u2019s push for greater Newspeak fluency among the public. The goal
    of the new alliance is to spread Newspeak among the youth and encourage \\d80children\\d80
    to incorporate it into their \\dC1speech\\dC1. It is estimated that by 2040, every
    citizen of Oceania will speak Newspeak as their first language, and thanks to
    initiatives like the Youth Newspeak Alliance, that time may come even sooner.
    Long Live Big Brother!"
