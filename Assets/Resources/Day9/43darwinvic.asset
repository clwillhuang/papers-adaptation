  message: Thanks to the work of Gen. Rahman and his troops, the city of Darwin has
    falled to Oceania without a single casualty amongst the Oceanian forces. Our forces
    \d70drove\d70 out the Eurasian occupants without issue. Gen. Rahman attributes
    the decisionful victory to stealth - rather than keeping his armys in the southern
    forests where the enemy was waiting, he keeped them in the city of Sleevies to
    the east, allowing him to catch the Eurasian forces off guard.
