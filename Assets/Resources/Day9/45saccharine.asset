  message: "Big Brother knows that our \\d80men\\d80 doing battle are the \\dB1most
    deserving\\dB1 of the sweet luxury. We receive 60 grams of saccharine a week,
    but it is a goodwise knowed fact that the human body uncan tell the difference
    between 30 and 60 grams of sugar. If everyone were to donate, our soldiers would
    never have to go without saccharine, and Eurasia would be leaved in terror at
    our sucrose-fueled war machine. It\u2019s your duty to the Party - and it\u2019s
    tantamount to treason to undonate."
