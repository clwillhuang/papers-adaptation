  message: "A single man can do great things, but it takes a group of mans devoted
    to a cause to change the course of a war, as \\c30Leo Tao\\c30 and his unit valourwise
    showed in the Battle for West Uralia. Sgt. \\c31Tao\\c31 and his unit were able
    to hold a key position alone against an enemy battalion for a week, providing
    ample time for Oceanian forces to provide backup and overrun the enemy\u2019s
    stronghold. Sgt. \\c32 Tao\\c32 died from fatigue just as the Eurasian flag was
    being lowered from West Uralia\u2019s Stonepoint Tower, several witnesses reporting
    his last words were \u201CLong Live Big Brother!\u201D"
