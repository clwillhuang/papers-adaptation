  message: As we enter the 9th day of Mourning Month, we must remember to unonly feel
    hate for the enemy for taking the lives of many of our brave mans, but to feel
    love for Big Brother and the good he lets us spread in the world. Through Big
    Brother, all things are possible - the story of Cpl. \c30Mueller\c30 being a chief
    example of this. \c31Mueller\c31, tired, alone, and caked in the blood of his
    falled comrades, was facing down 14 Eurasian soldiers with only 7 bullets in his
    magazine. Undeterred, he beginned firing, and miraclewise, each of the 7 bullets
    splitted in half as they were fired, killing all 14 enemy soldiers. \c32Ethan
    Mueller\c32 died that night from injurys sustained during the battle, but his
    story will live on forever, a true testament to the glory of Big Brother.
