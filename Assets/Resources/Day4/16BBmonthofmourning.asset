  message: "As the war in Eurasia enters its third year,  the number of casualtys
    is growing, prompting Big Brother to declare a month of mourning to honor the
    falled. Party members are to devote 10 minutes each morning to remembering those
    killed in the war, and The Times will issue a month-long series profiling postdeathful
    recipients of the Big Brother Medal of Peace. One day, we won\u2019t have to worry
    about the Eurasian menace - but today, it\u2019s up to us to fight it, through
    joining the army and following Big Brother down the path to Victory."
