  message: "Big Brother has introduced his \u201CFraternomics\u201D plan, which he
    explains uses \u201CTrickle Sideways Economics\u201D to homogenize the economys
    of Oceania and Eastasia. The new plan involves \\dA0dynamically\\dA0 moving funds
    to where they are needed most in the war against Eurasia - that includes across
    nations. For the next few months, several constructful projects in Airstrip One
    will be halted, but unhave fear, because as Big Brother assures us, money will
    eventualwise \u201Ctrickle sideways\u201D, and we will experience an economic
    boom. Long Live Big Brother!"
