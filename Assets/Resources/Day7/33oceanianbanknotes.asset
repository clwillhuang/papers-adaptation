  message: Following the wisdom of economic powerhouses such as Zimbabwe and Westphalia,
    Big Brother has devised a way to increase \dC0inflation\dC0 rates so that each
    and every citizen has ten times the amount of money they had at the beginning
    of the year. The new \dC1inflation\dC1 rates will allow banknotes to display larger
    numbers while retaining similar values. If all goes well, one day we may see one
    trillion pound notes - until then, Long Live Big Brother!
