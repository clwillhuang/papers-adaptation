  message: As the Party always words, the actions of one must always serve the needs
    of the many, and \c30Henry Zhang\c30 is a chief example of taking this maxim to
    heart. Lt. \c31Zhang\c31, stranded in the wild with his unit, relinquished his
    food to his comrades, allowing them to survive until rescue arrived but starving
    to death himself. Lt. \c32Zhang\c32 died with an unfull stomach and a full smile,
    knowing he had faithwise served the party.
