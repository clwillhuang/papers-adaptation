  message: The Eurasian army has in effect \d70given\d70 up on fighting us. As Minipax
    Geoeconomic Director \c31Nostra Damus\c31 explained, people in the hospitals are
    unlikelyer to fight back than Oceanic troops, a strategy discovered long ago by
    the great minds of the Minipax guerilla war division. In response, Minipax has
    enlisted every patient across the globe in fighting Eurasia, gracing them with
    the opportunity to fight for Big Brother from the hospital bed and show their
    loyalty to the Party. Long Live Big Brother!
