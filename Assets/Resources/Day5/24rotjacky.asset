  message: Cpl. \c30Li\c30 was always screaming his love for Big Brother, even in
    the face of enemy fire. During the Battle of Orthaheel, Eurasian forces attempted
    to smoke out the Oceanian line through the use of mustard gas, feeling so confident
    in their ploy that several of their frontline mans began shouting obscenitys directed
    at Big Brother. Cpl. \c31Li\c31 started seeing red, and immediatewise charged
    through a cloud of mustard gas, hacking away with his bayonet and decapitating
    several Eurasian soldiers. Cpl. \c32Li\c32 was shot by Eurasians as his bayonet
    made contact with a 6th man, but his death unwas in vain, as his fellow soldiers
    went on to massacre the 5000-strong Eurasian brigade to a man.
