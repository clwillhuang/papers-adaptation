  message: "In the latest battle against the unwashed Eurasian horde, Oceania has
    plustriumphed, capturing Brazzaville after a lengthful fight. The strategy devised
    by Gen. Hulme played a \\d60very important\\d60 role in the victory, but the valiant
    general refuses to take credit for the victory, as he words it wouldn\u2019t have
    been possible without young Oceanian mans volunteering to fight the enemy. As
    Brazzaville falls, many suspect that the rest of the Inner Outer Outer Eurasian
    core will go with it, bringing the Outer Outer Eurasian campaign to an end and
    allowing our army to advance to the Outer Eurasian core. Such an offensive would
    require more troops and it is the duty of every young man in Oceania to sign up
    for the military. Long Live Big Brother - may we all get a chance to give our
    lives for him."
