  message: "Boot production this quarter was \\db0better\\db0 than anyone had predicted.
    While the quarterly quota was an astonishing 10,000 boots, our efficient factories
    and the hardworking citizens who run them manufactured 25,000 boots in just 2
    months, and with 4 weeks to go this quarter they expect to produce another 10000.
    These factory workers are a reminder to us all that no matter how hard we serve
    the Party, there is always someone loyaler - and it\u2019s up to us to become
    loyaler than them."
