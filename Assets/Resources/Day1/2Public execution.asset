  message: 'With the aid of the Spies, the Party has captured a group of seemingwise
    mild-mannered parents who were planning out a series of car bombings intended
    to kill members of Minipax and aid Eurasia in the current conflict. These arrests
    are linked to a recent Party initiative to completely eliminate all terrorist
    activity by the year 2000, being the hundredth cell arrested this month.  The
    ungoodthinkful \d80men\d80 had confessed to all their \d91criminal\d91 \d82activities\d82.
    In celebration of arresting twice the monthly quota, their execution has been
    scheduled for the Hate tomorrow, to the joy of the good citizens of Oceania. '
