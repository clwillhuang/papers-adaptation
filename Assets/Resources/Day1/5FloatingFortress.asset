  message: "As the second millennium draws to a close, technology proves importanter
    and importanter in our lives, from the telescreen to the numberful warcraft wonders
    invented by the specialists at Minipax. The Floating Fortress (FF) unveiled last
    month finally saw frontline action, picking off enemy airplanes with ease, eliminating
    what some estimate to be half the Eurasian air fleet. Like all things Eurasian,
    the air group was ruthless and barbarianful in their technique, but their callousness
    couldn\u2019t overcome the poor design of their planes. The anti-air defences
    of the FF proved \\dB0more powerful\\dB0 than the enemy machines, causing some
    to remark that the airful end of the Outer Inner West Eurasian campaign may soon
    draw to a close. Whatever the outcome, we are all indebted to Minipax for protecting
    us from the Eurasian horde - Long Live Big Brother!!!"
