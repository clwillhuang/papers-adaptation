  m_EditorClassIdentifier: 
  message: "Minipax has discovered an Eastasian spy ring in Airstrip One planning
    to infiltrate Miniluv. The group was \\d70found\\d70 operating out of an unbig
    flat in London. Big Brother has personwise demanded the execution of everyone
    associated with the ring, but has decided to leave Eastasia undestroyed, as they
    have denounced the ring and redoubled their economic alliance with us. We can
    thank our Eastasian neighbours for their support in our war against Eurasia, but
    the discovery of the ring makes us all wonder: \u201CCan we really trust anyone
    other than Big Brother?\u201D"
